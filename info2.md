# Preliminaries


## Why learning to program?

- "With computers, either you are their slave, our they are your slaves". 

- It is hard to imagine a cognitive scientist who does not have a basic knowledge of computers and programming. Cognitive Science argueably started with the invention of computing by people like Alan Turing

- Because it is fun...


## Coding

There are only a few really fundamental concepts in programming: data (and their types), variables, tests (control flow) and functions. 

Once you know these concepts, learning a new programming language essentially entails:

- learning the syntax of the language 
- learning the vocabulary, that is, apart from a few basic keywords, the functions made available by the language.

I recommend playing with the visual programming language _Scratch_ (http://scratch.mit.edu) as it allows to acquire the fundamental concepts avoing frustrations with syntax and vocabulary (see http://www.pallier.org/crash-course-in-programming-with-scratch.html#crash-course-in-programming-with-scratch).


Python, unlike Scratch, is a _general purpose language_, in that it is suitable for (nearly) any kind of tasks. The drawback is that it takes longer to learn. Yet, contrary to most other programming languages, Python was not designed to be used exclusively by computer scientists. It strikes just the right balance between power and simplicity, and is well adapted to non professional programmers.

## Your aim should not simply be to write programs that works !

Your aim should be to write programs that work and _that you and other people can understand from reading the source code_ 

At a high level, coding is not unlike writing a text for humans: You must think about your reader and structure your code in a logical fashion, and use as appropiate names as possible for variables and functions. Also, you start from a first draft, and will modify it many times. A good design is when there is nothing more to remove.

If this point is the only one you remember from this lecture, it would already be a success.

## Software

You should download and install:

  * The Anaconda3 distribution from  https://www.continuum.io/downloads 
  * The Atom text editor from https://atom.io/

Beware, there exist several versions of Python. We strongly recommend that you version 3 (version 3.6 at the time of this writing).

One can run Python interactively in the terminal with `ipython`, or within a browser with `jupyter notebooks`. One advantage of the jupyter notebooks is that they are _persistent_. 

To write sligtly more complex programs (aka. scripts), or reusable modules, one needs to write Python code with a text editor, such as `atom` or `sublimeText`, or a development environment sych as `spyder` or `pyCharm`. 

See "How to run Python"

We will use a slack workgroup (aip2017-info2.slack.com) to exchange during the lecture. Request an invitation if you have not received one.

1. write code that asks the user to type some text, and when enter is pressed, prints the number of characters (hint: use the funtion `len`)

1. write code that asks the user for a price and print the price with 33% reduction. Try to find a way to print the new price with only to 2 decimal places.

1. write code that computes your income tax, obeying the following rules:

    * All taxpayers are charged a flat tax rate of 20%.
    * All taxpayers are allowed a $10,000 standard deduction.
    * For each dependent, a taxpayer is allowed an additional $2000 deduction.


1. Write code that repeatedly asks for number and prints whether there are odd or even (the modulo operator is `%`). The loop should stop when the user enters '0'. 

1. Write code that computes the sum of the first 1000 integers (tip: use a `while` loop).

1. The following program draws a triangle. Modify it to draw a square, then any regular polygon with 'n' sides.

1. Write a program that estimates the number PI/4 by drawing pairs of random numbers between 0 and 1 (`x, y = random.random(), random.random()`)and computes how many of them represent points within the unit circle (`x**2 + y**2 <= 1`).

1. Given a binary number represented as a string of 0s ans 1s (e.g. '101'), compute its value and print it.
 
1. Given an integer number, convert it into its binary representation, as a  string of 0s and 1s.

Pour l'achat d'au moins 3DVD, il est consenti une réduction de 15% sur le DVD. Construire un programme permettant d'obtenir le prix à payer suivant le nombre n de CD et m de DVD achetés."

1. Write a program to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

1. Write a program that plays the "guess a number" game: the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, asks you to make a guess and tells you if the guess is correct, too low or too high.

* Exercices

1. Write code, that asks the user for a text, and then prints in reverse (e.g. inputting 'Hello' should produce 'olleH').

1. Two taxi companies propose differents pricing schemes: "Tarif A: prise en charge de 4.80€ puis 1.15€ par km parcouru. Tarif B: prise en charge de 3.20€ puis 1.20€ par km parcouru." Ecrire un programme permettant de décider quelle compagnie choisir en fonction du nombre de kms à parcourir.

* Exercices



1. Write a function that reads a text file and count how many words (tokens) it contains (we consider that a word is simply anything between two whitespaces). 

1. Write a function that reads a text file and count how many different words (types) it contains.

1. Write a function that computes the number of occurrences of each word type in a text. First, consider that tokens are anything separated by whitespaces. In a second step, improve you function to clean the punctuations, ignore case changes, etc...

1. Write a script that renames all the files in the current directory using their date of creation as new name, keeping their extention (use module `os` and `os.path`)

## Level 4

- Numerical computing with numpy and scipy: Read sections 1.3 and 1.4 of the scipy lectures: http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/index.html 

- Data manipulation with pandas. Try some tutorials at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html


## Projects 


1. Write a simulator of a _Rodrego Register Machine_ (https://sites.tufts.edu/rodrego/). The input is a list of instructions (no need for line numbers).

1. program one or several of the Sudoku solvers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms)

1. Program a cellular Automata (See Chapter 6 of _Think Complexity_.  http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-complexity/)

1. program a Pong game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) or a breakout game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game) . You may use  `pygame`, `pySDL2` or `pyglet`.

1. Write a program implementing a psychological experiment --- the Simon task (https://www.researchgate.net/figure/266736582_fig6_Figure-2-Trial-structure-and-stimuli-A-four-alternative-Simon-task-in-which-two-colors).  The exeriment is a succession of trials where either a green or a red disk is displayed. The user must press a left button for green disk, and a right button for red disk. Their reaction time is measures, in milliseconds. The trick is that the disks appear either at the left or at the right of a central fixation point. Althought location is irrelevant to perform the task, one typically observed an increase in reaction times when the side of display and the side of response are incongruent. To program this experiment, you should use the `expyriment` module.

1. Write a program implementing a psychological experiment: The _Attentional Network Task_ (ANT), using the `expyriment` module. (see https://www.researchgate.net/figure/265392381_fig1_Schematic-illustration-of-the-attention-network-test-ANT-as-applied-in-our-study-A)
