    # Read the fraction

    a = int(input("numerator? "))
    b = int(input("denominator? "))

    # A first solution is to divide the numerator and denominator by their gcd 

    from math import gcd

    c = gcd(a, b)
    print("{}/{}".format(a // c, b // c))

    # A second solution relies on the existence of the *fractions* module

    from fractions import Fraction

    d = Fraction(a, b)
    print(d)
